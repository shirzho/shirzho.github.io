          The first step I took was to go online and do some research on product service system (PSS) companies that I was interested. I took time to sketch out how I understood their different PSS models to work and looked into the different stakeholders and services involved in each.

        <p class = "font-weight-light">
          I chose care/of because they bundle vitamins and get rid of the hassle of having 5-6 bottles of pills which you repetitively open up and take each morning. They are also very thoughtful about their product/service and their users.

          I selected Bird as the company to make my PSS poster on because of the complexity of interactions among the different stakeholders.
          I did some preliminary research on the company in order to understand any problems they might be facing, when they were created, and any information that might help me have a better overall comprehension of company culture and most importantly how their product service model worked.

          I played around with portrait and landscape formats, but ultimately went with the idea in the bottom right corner which had a simple top to bottom flow and split the poster into thirds.

        <p class = "font-weight-light">
          I wanted to utilize graphics and simple images in my poster to make for a more visual and easier to understand experience.

          Because of this, some things I knew I wanted to include were:

        <ul class = "font-weight-light" >
          <li>A section that demonstrated in simplest terms how Bird works as a product service</li>

          I wanted to add more to the back- ground and decided to go with a blurred out image for the top third of the page. It also helps emphasize to the audience where the point of entry is for the poster.

          I added more hierachical components to the previous blocks of text so it is clear- er to look at. I also broke down sentences into bullets so that itâ€™s easier to skim through.
