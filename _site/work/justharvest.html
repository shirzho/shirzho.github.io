          Economic injustice is at the root of all hunger. Through a process of focusing on public policy and empowering the community, Allegheny county has a goal of addressing hunger and improving quality of life.
          To address this problem, we will research and collaboratively design new data-driven services with Just Harvest, a non-profit organization that reduces hunger through sustainable, long-term approaches that benefit stakeholders in need. Just Harvest leverages public policy and programs to reduce poverty and improve food access.

      <h6>PESTLE ANALYSIS</h6>
        <p class = "font-weight-light">
          After evaluating political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental (PESTLE) factors that affect Just Harvest and its activities, we had the following insights:
        </p>

        <ol class = "font-weight-light">

          <li>Just Harvest is reliant on the functioning of the government and its policies which are constantly changing.</li>
          <br>

          <li>There are initiatives to get healthy food to all socio-economic groups but there are fast food chains that beat these programs in terms of price and convenience.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Basic technologies are not a problem with low-income EBT users.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Food wastage is a problem along with people not getting access to fresh food.
          Transportation is also a problem as not all low-income individuals have the time and money to afford it</li>

      <h6>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h6>
      <p class = "font-weight-light">
        In conducting our competitive analysis we looked at other local Pittsburgh non-profit organizations which work in the fields of food insecurity and fresh food distribution. We also looked at technologies that allow users to utilize their SNAP benefits more easily such as mobile apps. Lastly, we looked at software that also deal heavily in the application filling process such as Intuit’s TurboTax which might give insight towards how the SNAP application process can be made quicker and more intuitive.

      <h6>STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS</h6>
      <p class = "font-weight-light">
        We performed stakeholder analysis to identify the different stakeholders involved in the project and to specify the relationship among them. We created a stakeholder map for this part, in which we visualized the interaction between Just Harvest and different organizations and people. We believe DHS should be of high influence to Just Harvest as well as the project that we are working on. There may be people who are qualified for SNAP but aren’t enrolled since this is also a pain point that has been mentioned by Just Harvest. We find this to be another opportunity area that we can work on to maximize the efficiency of the whole system and let people receive the benefits that they deserve.
