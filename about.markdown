##### Hi there! I'm 周雪睿.

A Canadian-born Chinese American currently at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.deloittedigital.com) improving design and functionality of government products. Previously, I studied Information Systems, Human Computer Interaction, and Business at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu).

Outside of work, you can find me [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/shur.png), reading lots of fiction, and bouldering. I also spend a lot of time reflecting upon the differences of eastern & western cultures.
